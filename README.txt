This is a simple Javascript interface to the Crossfit Open leaderboard API.
I made it so that I could jump to a page within the results, but I might add
more features later.

To use it, you will need to disable cross-origin security: start Chrome/Chromium
with the --disable-web-security and --user-data-dir options appended.  Do not
browse the web with these security options disabled!!
